    <p>Description:
      This is the first video to have a description. With this new feature I can say that this was recorded at my house and not at school.
      This video was meant to be released on New Year day with footage of both New Year day and New Year's Eve but due to technical issues, it only has footage from New Years Day and is being uploaded on 1/2/2024</p>
